# Tetris-Clone
This is a clone of the classic video game Tetris. The purpose behind this is to create a controlled environment for a soon-to-be-developed Tetris AI. Information about my implementation of the game is listed below.

## Controls

## Game Pieces
Each game piece is represented on a 5 x 5 grid. A zero indicates and empty space; a one indicates a segment of a game piece; a two indicates a pivot point of a game piece. The pivot point is the segment where each piece rotates clockwise.
